# Dispatch-Speed
This code increases your _segmented download_ speed by assigning multiple IPs to your **NIC** dynamically. This task is accomplished using [Dispatch proxy](https://github.com/Morhaus/dispatch-proxy). Routing all your traffic through a local proxy socket server.

This scripts eliminates the need of choosing your _interface_ manually and require _no prior_ knowledge of dealing with IPs.
